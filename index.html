     Photography is a form of art that allows people to express themselves or simply capture a special moment. More than over 1 trillion photos are taken each year.  The most viewed photograph in the history is the Windows XP’s default wallpaper.  One of the most famous images of the 20th century, the “Afghan Girl” was taken in 1984 and published in National Geographic in 1985. However, the girl in the image didn’t know it became world famous until she was shown her own photo in 2002.

  <h6>In photography you CAN just take pictures with the regular settings you have on your phone, computer, or camera. However, there are other options to make your picture look way better. The phone cmaera quality isn't the same as a camera quality. But there are ways to make it look somewhat alike.</h6>
  <br> Snapseed mobile app is an app for mobile users who want to make their pictures look better or more creative. It is used for editing; changing exposure, contrast, saturation and more. </br>
  <br> Adobe lightroom interface and DXO photlab 4 are both good editing apps that are used on laptop/computer but Adobe lightroom interface can also be used on phone. Adobe lightroom interface is not only a good app but it can be eaisly accesible. It has a left panel where you can toggle betwen pictures as you edit and a right panel where you can make quick adjustmets. DXO photolab is another good editing app it is known for being able to make a picture more smoother and clearer.

  <h6 class ="animate__zoomIn">What exactly do you need to be taking pictures? You may ask. There are two different types of cameras. There are digital cameras and regular cameras. The BIG difference between a digital camera and a regular camera is that a digital camera gives you the ability to change the lenses and to use different lesnses for different occasions. </h6>
  <br> What are lenses? </br>
  <br> Lenses are used to be able to look at faraway objects much closer. Theres also different types of lenses such as platic, glass and even a combination of both. It is highly recommended to get glasss lenses because they offer much more clarity. </br> 
  <br>Often digital cameras tend to come with the body only and not the lenses. Most of the time you will have to just buy the lenses sepeartly which is often better because you get to choose the type of lense that you want wether it's small or big.  </br>
  <br><h6> Do lenses work with any camera?</h6></br>
  <br>If you buy a certain brand of camera, you have to buy the same brand of lenses because cameras have a certain way lenses should be mounted on to the camera. </br>
